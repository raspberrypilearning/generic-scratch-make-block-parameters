+ You can create blocks that have 'gaps' to add data. These 'gaps' are called **parameters**. To add parameters, click **Options**, then click the type of data you want to add and then give your data a name.

+ If you want to add some text between parameters, you can add label text:

+ You can then define your new block, and use the data by dragging the circular blocks to use them in your code.
